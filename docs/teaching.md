# Teaching

The Anderson Lab plays a central role in teaching synthetic biology at UC Berkeley, with course offerings that integrate wetlab skills, computational tools, and real-world project experience. The following are core instructional efforts led by Prof. J. Christopher Anderson:

## Online Cloning Tutorials

To support teaching in synthetic biology, the Anderson Lab also maintains an online repository of educational materials for genetic design and wetlab training.

Visit: [Cloning Tutorials](https://ucb-bioe-anderson-lab.github.io/cloning-tutorials/)

This resource includes:

- Step-by-step guides for essential molecular biology techniques
- Tutorials on DNA construction and simulation
- Protocols for wetlab experiments used in BioE 140L
- Visualization tools for understanding plasmid features

The site is an evolving companion to our courses, especially BioE 140L, and provides a foundation for students beginning in synthetic biology.

## BioE 140L: Synthetic Biology Laboratory

**Semester**: Spring  
**Units**: 4  
**Format**: 2 hrs lecture + 6 hrs lab/week  
**Prerequisites**: BioE11 or Bio1A

**Description**:  
An intensive, project-based course introducing students to the tools and mindset of modern synthetic biology. Students learn wetlab techniques like PCR, cloning, genome editing, and data analysis while contributing to real group research projects. Lectures cover standardized assembly, gene synthesis, directed evolution, and biosecurity. The course culminates in an independent innovation project.

**Objectives**:

- Master wetlab techniques
- Interpret experimental results and iterate
- Coordinate and execute group genetic engineering projects
- Understand responsible scientific conduct

## BioE 134 / 234: Biodesign Automation

**Semester**: Fall  
**Units**: 4  
**Format**: 3 hrs lecture + 1 hr discussion/week  
**Prerequisites**: CS 61A or equivalent Python + BioE11 or Bio1A

**Description**:  
A unique fusion of computer science and synthetic biology, this course teaches students to design genetic engineering workflows as software systems. Topics include CRISPR design, pathway synthesis, data structures, and software testing. Students complete multiple programming assignments and a team-based final project that builds AI-assisted biodesign tools.

**Objectives**:

- Translate biodesign problems into software
- Use algorithms and data structures for biological workflows
- Implement and evaluate tools using Python, Colab, and GitHub
- Collaborate effectively in team-based engineering
