# Anderson Lab @ UC Berkeley

Welcome to the Anderson Lab website at the University of California, Berkeley. We specialize in **synthetic biology**, combining cutting-edge experimental techniques with advanced computational tools to engineer biological systems with precision and purpose.

## About the Lab

Led by Professor J. Christopher Anderson, our lab focuses on areas such as:

- Genetic Design Automation
- Therapeutic Bacteria Engineering
- BioCAD Software Tools
- DNA Fabrication Methods
- Synthetic Biocontainment Strategies

We develop foundational technologies to advance synthetic biology, and apply these tools to problems in health, sustainability, and biotechnology.

## Opportunities

We offer training and mentorship for:

- Undergraduate researchers
- Master of Engineering (MEng) students
- PhD students and postdocs
- Visiting scholars

Learn more in the [Teaching](teaching/bioe134.md) and [Research](research/projects.md) sections.

## Recent Highlights

- Development of ligand-dependent synthetic auxotrophs for biosafety
- Commercialization efforts through Synvivia and 20n
- Publications in top journals including *ACS Synth Biol*, *Nature Biotech*, and *PNAS*
